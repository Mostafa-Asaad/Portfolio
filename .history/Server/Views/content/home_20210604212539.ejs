       <p style="color:black" >A GIS software developer with a Masterâ€™s degree in Geographic Information System and Cartography from University of Aberdeen.
                             I also have background in Geomatics Engineering with 3 years of experience in the domain. 
                             My latest experience and projects were focused on using spatial analysis, R programming as well as remote sensing techniques in GIS.
                              Currently I am completing a fast track program in software technology and looking forward to implementing this knowledge in GIS.</p>
