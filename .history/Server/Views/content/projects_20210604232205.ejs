                            <p class="card-text">This was the thesis in my Master's degree in GIS. In this project, I used MCE methods to detect walkability patterns in Mississauga and Brampton cities.
                             This final map shows areas that are highly attractive for pedestrains and bikers and others that are not. The results were derived based on 6 developed maps:</p>
                            <li>Proximity to destination map</li>
                            <li>Residential density map</li>
                            <li>Commercial density map</sli>
                            <li>Walk friendliness map</li>
                            <li>Land-use diversity map</li>

                                <p class="card-text">This study adopted the spatiotemporal approach to map crimes in the City of Toronto. 
                                It identified the advantages of using the micro-level of space when conducting crime mapping and proved that as we move downwards in the cone of spatial resolution, the results are more accurate which helps the police in the better deployment of patrols across the city. Their effort will be more focused on roads with a high crime rate instead of safe roads and as a result, this will save money and effort.
                                Unlike the spatial resolution, performing crime analysis along the temporal cone of resolution proved to be significant at all levels. Criminologists can derive important patterns from analyzing the change of crimes along hours, days, weeks, months or years.</p>
